# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the transformation of UpPaws into "UpPaws: Animal Trainer" - a Pokémon-inspired animal collection and battle game that meets Reddit's Developer Platform games featuring program standards. The enhanced UpPaws will evolve from a simple daily puzzle into an immersive animal training RPG with creature collection, turn-based battles, habitat exploration, and deep progression systems while maintaining educational value about real animals.

### Core Concept: Pokémon-Style Animal Training

Players become Animal Trainers who discover, collect, and train real-world animals through puzzle-solving mechanics. Each successfully solved animal puzzle "captures" that animal to your collection, where they can be trained, evolved, and used in strategic turn-based battles against other trainers.
