## 🎮 Gameplay

UpPaws presents a daily emoji and a shuffled bank of letters. Drag/tap to fill the answer slots with letters to spell the animal.

### Daily Mode
- One shared puzzle per day (UTC) for all players.
- You can earn points once per day. Subsequent correct guesses still show the fact but award no points.
- Scoring: base 5 points, up to +5 time bonus (faster = more), and -2 if you used the hint.
